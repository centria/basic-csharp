Welcome to the Basics of Programming with C# course!

## If you just want to learn

To attend the course, you do not have to be a student in Centria University of Applied science. All the material and exercises are available online. If you want to get ECTS credits for the course, you have to register to Centria Open University.


## Registering to Open University

You can register to the course from [HERE](https://ella.eduplan.fi/centria).

<Note>Centria students don't have to enroll to Open University, but enroll from Peppi!</Note>


## Learning goals and grading


The list below does not include everything, but exists to give a guideline for students, what to expect each week.

| Part | Goal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | You can write simple programs, which read user input and for example basic calculations. You know the terms **variable**, **conditional** or **if**, and **while-loop** and can use them in the programs.                                                                     |
|  2   | You know the logical operators, such as **and**, **or** and **not** and can use them in conditionals and while-loops. You know what **methods**, **method parameters** and **method return** mean, how to create them and what happens in the program while a method is used. |
|  3   | You can comment your code and understand how naming variables affects the readibility of code. You understand the basics of **lists** and can use them in your programs, and iterate through a list.                                                                          |
|  4   | You comprehend the terms **file** and **filesystem** and can read a simple file with your program. You know the basics for **Object oriented programming** and how to use this information in your programs.                                                                  |
|  5   | You know the different **data types** and how they differ from each other. You can **overload** methods and **constructors**. You can use all these in your programs.                                                                                                         |
|  6   | You understand the dfference between **static** and **non-static** classes and methods. You can separate **user interface** from program logic.                                                                                                                               |


The course is graded on a scale of 0-5. The grade comprises of the amount of exercise points earned.

| Percentage done | Grade |
| :-------------- | :---: |
| 90 % or more    |   5   |
| 80 % - 89,99 %  |   4   |
| 70 % - 79,99 %  |   3   |
| 60 % - 69,99 %  |   2   |
| 50 % - 59,99 %  |   1   |
| Less than 50 %  |   0   |

At the end of the course, there is also an exam with **pass / fail** grading. This does not affect the grade but is to ensure that you have done the exercises yourself. The exam is reserved for students of Centria University of Applied Sciences and Centria Open University, and you can find the registeration information from above. The course material and the exercises are available still for anyone who wants.
